Jersey Family Fun will be a gem that scrapes www.njkidsonline.com to provide the user with a list of family-oriented events that are happening in New Jersey on that particular day. The user will be greeted, then provided with a list of statewide events that will include the title, description, and a link to more event details. The user should then be able to read through the list, choose to get more information about any of the events listed, and exit when they wish.
